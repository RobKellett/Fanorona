A Game Called Fanorona - by Rob Kellett

This game requires JRE 8 to run.

This version of the game does not support capture chaining.
After capturing pieces, your turn will end. Otherwise, all
rules of standard Fanorona are enforced.

When it's your turn, click the piece you want to move and
click where you want it to go. Only pieces that can be
moved can be selected; likewise, only valid destinations
for that piece are selectable. When it is possible to
do both an approach capture and a withdrawal capture,
simply click the destination to do an approach and hold
left shift and click to do a withdrawal. Press ESC to
return to the main menu.
